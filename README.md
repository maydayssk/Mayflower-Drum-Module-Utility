well hello this is my first time doing something like this, im not much of a developer lol


This is a project that means a lot to me, I broke my right foot ankle in December of 2024 and since then I couldn't really use the foot pedals anymore
My ankles just hurt too much for it to be reliable :(

So I made this so I can basically make any instrument sound like any other! I have literally tested a small MIDI keyboard by using drum sounds so far lol
I wanna make it easy for anyone to use this app regardless of experience with coding, since this is also my first time coding anything
